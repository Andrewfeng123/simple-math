# Probability

## Definition

Probability is the likelihood of something happening. It is always between $0$ and $1$. It can also be expressed using a percentange, which can be from $0\%$ to $100\%$. To measure the probability of something, you can split the problem into several equally likely outcomes, and figure out how many desired outcomes there are. So, the probability of the thing happening would be $\dfrac{\text{# of desired outcomes}}{\text{# of total outcomes}}$. 

## Independence

Two events are independent if the probability of one of them doesn't affect the probability of the other. For example, say you roll two dice. The events that the first die rolls a $1$ and the second die rolls a $3$ are independent of each other because they are different rolls. However, if I have the event that the first die rolls a $1$ and the first die rolls a $3$, then they are not independent because if the first die rolls a $1$, then the second event can't happen.

## Conducting experiments to find probability

Suppose you want to figure out the probability of something. For example, I want to know what the probability that a coin lands heads. We know that the probability is $\dfrac12$ but suppose that we didn't know if heads and tails are equally likely. Then, we can conduct an experiment to figure out the probability of it happening. If we flip the coin $50$ times and $31$ of them are heads, then the probability the coin comes up heads would be approximately $\dfrac{31}{50}$ or $0.62$. If we conduct more trials, then the probability would be more accurate. For example, it we flip the coin $200$ times and $114$ of them were heads, then our estimate would be $0.57$.

## Sum of Probabilities

Say an event has several different outcomes. Then the sum of the probabilities of those outcomes equals $1$, or $100\%$.

## Odds

The odds in favour of a particular event is the ratio between the probability that the event happens and the probability that it doesn't happen. For example, if an event has a probability of $0.75$, then the odds in favour of the event would be $0.75:0.25$ or $3:1$ or just $3$.
