# Notion of a "whole"

According to Oxford Language, the definition of the word whole is "all of; entire". This is coherent with our mathematical definition of a whole.

Many teachers often get the questions like "Okay, I get it. If I add one apple to another, it becomes two. But how would you explain cutting an apple into two pieces? We still get TWO pieces."

The answer is related to the notion of a whole. We need to have the entire apple without any missing parts/bits of it in order to have one whole apple. This is a really important concept when enhancing children's understanding of natural numbers.

This notion of whole gets extremely useful when we are teaching fractions and how to do arithmetic with fractions. Because fractions are relative to what the "whole" is in each situation. If our whole is $2$, a third of the whole is $\frac{2}{3}$, not $\frac{1}{3}$.
