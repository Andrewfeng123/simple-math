# Rational Numbers

A rational number is a number that can be written as $\dfrac ab$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $b$ is not $$. Some examples would be:

- $5$. It might not seem like a rational number, but it is, because it can be expressed as $\dfrac51$.
- Literally any other integer. Every integer is a rational number because it can be expressed as $\dfrac{\text{that integer}}1$.
- $\dfrac22$. It is a rational number since it is a fraction.
- $-\dfrac53$. Rational numbers can also be negative!

A fraction can be written in horizontal form like $1/2$ or Â½, or it can be written in vertical form like $\dfrac12$.

Every rational number can be expressed as a decimal. The rational number $\dfrac34$ can be represented as $0.7$. The rational number $\dfrac{12345}{12500}$ can be represented as $0.987$. However, sometings decimals can repeat. For example, consider $\dfrac13$. If we try doing long division on that, we cannot get a remainder of $$. Why is that? Because if we have $10$, and divide that by $3$, then the remainder is $1$. And we're going to multiply that by $10$ again to get $10$ and the remainder when divided by $3$ is going to be $1$ again. However, there is a pattern: every time we divide the quotient is $3$, and so the decimal is going to look something like this:

$0.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333-$

Okay. Hold on a second. This decimal is going to go on forever! Whenever a decimal goes forever and repeats, it is called a repeating decimal. (Also, if a decimal doesn't go forever, it is a terminating decimal.) We can use ellipses to write the decimal, like this:

$0.333\ldots$

However, there is another notation we can use. Instead of writing ellipses, we can write:

$0.\overline3$

So, if we had something like $0.109109\ldots$, we don't need to write the whole thing, just $0.\overline{109}$.
